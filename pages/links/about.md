# About Me and This Website

## About Me: A Glimpse Into My Tech Journey

Hi! I’m a student from the **Computer Engineering Department** at **Indus University, Ahmedabad**. My interests revolve around **Web Development**, **Cybersecurity**, **Ethical Hacking**, and **Computer Forensics**.

Let’s keep my name a mystery for now 😄, but I’m always happy to connect and collaborate!

## The Website’s Journey

This website began as a fun project for a group of five close friends. Over time, it turned into something useful for peers, so I decided to publish it. I’ve since polished its look and added helpful functionalities, making it a resource for everyone.

## Looking Ahead

This website will **always remain free**!  
It’s not because I can’t implement payment gateways, but because I believe in making learning resources accessible to everyone.

Some points about the future of this project:

- 🚀 The technology or UI might change as needed.
- 🎨 Features will continue to evolve based on user feedback.
- 💡 Suggestions are welcome! Fill out the form in the [Links Section](../links).

As the sole owner of this website, I make all decisions—but I value your input to make this platform even better.
