# Unit 1

## <mark> 1) Define a distributed system and list its key characteristics. </mark>

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single coherent system. These computers communicate and coordinate their actions by exchanging messages.

Here are the key characteristics of a distributed system:

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Concurrency:**
  - Multiple components operate simultaneously.
  - This enables parallel processing and improved performance.
- **Lack of a Global Clock:**
  - There's no single, shared clock across all components.
  - This makes it difficult to synchronize actions and maintain a consistent view of time.
- **Independent Failures:**
  - Components can fail independently of each other.
  - The system must be designed to tolerate failures and maintain availability.
- **Resource Sharing:**
  - Components share resources such as data, hardware, and software.
  - This allows for efficient resource utilization.
- **Heterogeneity:**
  - Components can have different hardware, operating systems, and network protocols.
  - The system must be able to integrate these diverse components.
- **Scalability:**
  - The system should be able to handle increasing workloads by adding more components.
  - This is a core requirement for many modern systems.
- **Transparency:**
  - The system should hide the complexity of distribution from users.
  - Users should interact with the system as if it were a single, centralized system.
- **Openness:**
  - The system should offer standardized interfaces that enable it to be easily extended and improved by adding new components or by replacing existing ones.
- **Communication:**
  - Components communicate through a network, typically by passing messages.
  - The network's reliability and performance can significantly impact the system's overall behavior.

In essence, a distributed system aims to achieve high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance by leveraging the power of multiple interconnected computers.
