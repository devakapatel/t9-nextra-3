## <mark> 26) Explain the common security threats in Edge and Fog Computing and their impact on IoT. </mark>

1. **Common Security Threats in Edge & Fog Computing:**

   - **Data Interception (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks):** Unencrypted data transmission is vulnerable to interception.
   - **Device Hijacking:** Attackers gain unauthorized control over IoT devices.
   - **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Overloading fog nodes or edge devices to disrupt operations.
   - **Malware & Ransomware:** Infects IoT nodes to steal or lock data.
   - **Weak Authentication:** Default passwords and weak encryption make devices easy targets.
   - **Physical Security Risks:** Fog nodes located in remote areas can be tampered with.

2. **Impact on IoT Systems:**

   - **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
   - **Operational Disruptions:** Attacks can shut down IoT networks.
   - **Loss of Trust:** Security failures damage user confidence in IoT technology.
   - **High Recovery Costs:** Repairing compromised systems can be expensive.
   - **Regulatory Fines:** Non-compliance with security regulations (e.g., GDPR) can lead to penalties.
   - **Data Integrity Issues:** Malicious actors can alter sensor readings, leading to incorrect decisions.

3. **Countermeasures:**
   - **End-to-End Encryption:** Protects data in transit.
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Ensures only authorized access.
   - **Regular Firmware Updates:** Fixes security vulnerabilities.
   - **Zero-Trust Architecture:** Requires continuous verification of device identity.
   - **AI-Based Intrusion Detection:** Uses AI to detect and prevent cyberattacks.
   - **Secure Boot & Hardware Security Modules (HSM):** Prevents unauthorized firmware modifications.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Limits permissions based on user roles.

## <mark> 27) Discuss the importance of data encryption and authentication mechanisms in securing IoT data acquisition. </mark>

1. **Importance of Data Encryption in IoT:**
   - Ensures confidentiality by converting data into an unreadable format.
   - Prevents eavesdropping and interception during transmission.
   - Protects sensitive user data in healthcare, financial transactions, etc.

**Types of Encryption Used in IoT:**

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Used for securing sensor data.
- **TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer):** Encrypts IoT data transmissions.
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Ensures only authorized devices can read the data.

2. **Importance of Authentication Mechanisms:**
   - Ensures only authorized devices and users can access IoT data.
   - Prevents spoofing attacks where fake devices pose as legitimate ones.
   - Strengthens network security by restricting unauthorized access.

**Authentication Methods:**

- **Username & Password:** Basic authentication (less secure).
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** Uses digital certificates for device authentication.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Requires an additional verification step.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Fingerprint or facial recognition for high-security applications.

## <mark> 28) How does regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) impact data acquisition and storage in IoT? </mark>

1. **What is Regulatory Compliance in IoT?**

   - Laws and regulations that govern how IoT data is collected, stored, and processed to protect user privacy.

2. **Key Regulations and Their Impact:**

   - **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - EU):**
     - Requires user consent for data collection.
     - Mandates data anonymization and encryption.
     - Allows users to request data deletion (Right to be Forgotten).
   - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - USA):**
     - Protects health-related IoT data (e.g., wearable health monitors).
     - Requires end-to-end encryption of patient data.
   - **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act - USA):**
     - Grants consumers control over their IoT data.
     - Requires transparent data policies.

3. **Compliance Challenges for IoT Companies:**
   - Ensuring secure storage and proper data handling.
   - Managing cross-border data transfers.
   - Implementing privacy-by-design principles in IoT devices.

## <mark> 29) A temperature sensor collects readings, but some contain noise. The following Python function applies a moving average filter to smooth out noise from the readings. What will be the output of this program? </mark>

```python
import numpy as np
def moving_average(sensor_data, window_size=3):
    smoothed_data = np.convolve(sensor_data, np.ones(window_size)/window_size, mode='valid')
    return smoothed_data
sensor_readings = [30, 32, 31, 29, 35, 36, 38]
filtered_readings = moving_average(sensor_readings, 3)
print(list(filtered_readings))
```

```
[31.0, 30.67, 31.67, 33.33, 36.33]
```

**Explanation:**
The function `moving_average()` calculates the average of the last `window_size` readings. It uses `np.convolve()` with a window of size 3, meaning each output value is the mean of three consecutive readings.

Applying the moving average on `[30, 32, 31, 29, 35, 36, 38]` results in:

- (30 + 32 + 31) / 3 = 31.00
- (32 + 31 + 29) / 3 = 30.67
- (31 + 29 + 35) / 3 = 31.67
- (29 + 35 + 36) / 3 = 33.33
- (35 + 36 + 38) / 3 = 36.33

Thus, the output is `[31.0, 30.67, 31.67, 33.33, 36.33]`.

## <mark> 30) The following Python script uses a simple threshold-based anomaly detection in IoT edge devices. What will be the output of this program? </mark>

```python
sensor_values = [23, 25, 28, 55, 30, 22, 60, 27, 29]
threshold = 40
anomalies = [value for value in sensor_values if value > threshold]
print("Anomalies detected:", anomalies)
```

```
Anomalies detected: [55, 60]
```

**Explanation:**
The list comprehension `[value for value in sensor_values if value > threshold]` filters out sensor readings above 40. Only 55 and 60 exceed `threshold = 40`, so they are classified as anomalies. The function returns `Anomalies detected: [55, 60]`.

## <mark> 31) In an IoT Edge computing scenario, a sensor device encodes and sends its readings as a JSON payload before transmitting them via MQTT. What will be the final output of this script? </mark>

```python
import json
sensor_data = {
    "temperature": 28.5,
    "humidity": 60,
    "device_id": "sensor_001"
}
json_payload = json.dumps(sensor_data, indent=2)
print(json_payload)
```

```json
{
  "temperature": 28.5,
  "humidity": 60,
  "device_id": "sensor_001"
}
```

**Explanation:**
The sensor data is stored in a Python dictionary. `json.dumps(sensor_data, indent=2)` converts it into a JSON string with formatted indentation. The output matches the JSON structure needed for MQTT or REST API transmission.

## <mark> 32) In an Edge Computing scenario, a smart factory uses multiple sensors to calculate the average reading for temperature and humidity. What will be the output of this program? </mark>

```python
sensors = {
    "temperature": [25, 27, 29, 30, 26],
    "humidity": [55, 60, 62, 59, 57]
}
average_temperature = sum(sensors["temperature"]) / len(sensors["temperature"])
average_humidity = sum(sensors["humidity"]) / len(sensors["humidity"])
print(f"Average Temperature: {average_temperature:.2f}°C")
print(f"Average Humidity: {average_humidity:.2f}%")
```

```
Average Temperature: 27.40°C
Average Humidity: 58.60%
```

**Explanation:**
The function computes the mean of temperature readings:

- (25 + 27 + 29 + 30 + 26) / 5 = 27.40

The function computes the mean of humidity readings:

- (55 + 60 + 62 + 59 + 57) / 5 = 58.60

The formatted output is:

```
Average Temperature: 27.40°C
Average Humidity: 58.60%
```

## <mark> 33) A smart edge device encrypts its sensor readings before sending them to a cloud server. What will be the output of this encryption program? </mark>

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# Generate a key for encryption
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(key)
message = b"Temperature: 30.5°C"
encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(message)
print("Encrypted:", encrypted_message)
decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message)
print("Decrypted:", decrypted_message.decode())
```

```
Encrypted: (some random unreadable binary data)
Decrypted: Temperature: 30.5°C
```

**Explanation:**
Fernet encryption is used to encrypt IoT sensor data before transmission. The `encrypt()` method converts readable text into encrypted binary form. The `decrypt()` method restores the original message:

```
Decrypted: Temperature: 30.5°C
```

Since encryption outputs randomized secure data, the actual "Encrypted" output varies every time.
