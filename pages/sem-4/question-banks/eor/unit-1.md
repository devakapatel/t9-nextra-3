# Unit 1: Fundamentals of Robot

## 1. (i) Explain the speed of motion in industrial robots. (ii) Explain the load-carrying capacity of a robot.

**Answer:**

(i) **Speed of Motion in Industrial Robots:**

The speed of motion in industrial robots refers to the rate at which the robot can move its end effector (the tool or gripper at the end of the robot arm) from one position to another. This speed is typically measured in units such as meters per second (m/s) or degrees per second (°/s). The speed of motion is a critical parameter in industrial applications, as it directly affects the efficiency and productivity of the robot. Factors that influence the speed of motion include the robot's design, the type of actuators used, the control system, and the payload being carried.

(ii) **Load-Carrying Capacity of a Robot:**

The load-carrying capacity of a robot refers to the maximum weight that the robot can handle while maintaining its performance and accuracy. This capacity is determined by the robot's mechanical design, the strength of its actuators, and the control system's ability to manage the additional weight. Exceeding the load-carrying capacity can lead to reduced accuracy, increased wear and tear, and potential damage to the robot. It is essential to consider the load-carrying capacity when selecting a robot for a specific application to ensure safe and efficient operation.

## 2. (i) With a neat sketch explain the three degrees of freedom associated with the robot wrist. (ii) Discuss the four types of robot controls.

**Answer:**

(i) **Three Degrees of Freedom Associated with the Robot Wrist:**

The robot wrist typically has three degrees of freedom, which allow it to orient the end effector in three-dimensional space. These degrees of freedom are:

1. **Roll:** Rotation around the longitudinal axis of the wrist.
2. **Pitch:** Rotation around the lateral axis of the wrist.
3. **Yaw:** Rotation around the vertical axis of the wrist.

A sketch of the robot wrist would show these three axes of rotation, illustrating how the wrist can move in three different directions to achieve the desired orientation of the end effector.

(ii) **Four Types of Robot Controls:**

1. **Point-to-Point Control:** In this type of control, the robot moves to predefined positions without concern for the path taken. It is suitable for applications where the exact path is not critical, such as pick-and-place operations.
2. **Continuous Path Control:** This control allows the robot to follow a specific path with high precision. It is used in applications like welding or painting, where the robot must follow a complex path.
3. **Adaptive Control:** Adaptive control systems can adjust the robot's behavior based on feedback from sensors. This allows the robot to respond to changes in the environment or task, improving accuracy and efficiency.
4. **Intelligent Control:** Intelligent control systems use advanced algorithms, such as artificial intelligence or machine learning, to make decisions and adapt to new situations. These systems can handle complex tasks and improve performance over time through learning.
