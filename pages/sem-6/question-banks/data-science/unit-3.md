## <mark> 7) What are some key methods for validating a Machine Learning model? </mark>

### **Key Methods for Validating a Machine Learning Model**

Model validation ensures that a machine learning model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Below are some commonly used **validation techniques**:

### **1. Train-Test Split**

✅ **Splits the dataset into two parts:**

- **Training Set** (e.g., 80%) → Used to train the model.
- **Testing Set** (e.g., 20%) → Used to evaluate the model’s performance.

📌 **Example:** A fraud detection model is trained on **80% of transactions** and tested on **20% unseen data**.

🔹 **Pros:** Simple, fast.  
🔹 **Cons:** The model might overfit if the test set is too small.

### **2. Cross-Validation (K-Fold Cross-Validation)**

✅ **Splits the data into K subsets ("folds")** and trains the model multiple times:

1. The model is trained on $K-1$ folds.
2. The remaining 1 fold is used for validation.
3. This process repeats $K$ times, with each fold used once as the test set.

📌 **Example:** If $K=5$, the dataset is split into **5 parts**, and the model is trained **5 times** using different test sets.

🔹 **Pros:** More reliable than train-test split.  
🔹 **Cons:** Computationally expensive for large datasets.

### **3. Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**

✅ A variation of K-Fold Cross-Validation that **ensures each fold has the same proportion of each class** in classification problems.

📌 **Example:** If 30% of emails in a spam filter dataset are spam, each fold will maintain the **30% spam ratio**.

🔹 **Pros:** Works well for imbalanced datasets.  
🔹 **Cons:** Slightly more complex than standard K-Fold.

### **4. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**

✅ **A special case of K-Fold where $K=n$ (number of samples).**

- Each data point is **used once as a test set**, while the rest are used for training.

📌 **Example:** If there are **100 samples**, the model is trained **99 times**, leaving **1 sample for testing each time**.

🔹 **Pros:** Uses maximum data for training.  
🔹 **Cons:** Computationally expensive for large datasets.

### **5. Holdout Validation**

✅ **A simpler version of Train-Test Split** where a portion of the dataset is never used for training and is **held out** for final evaluation.

📌 **Example:** A **20% holdout set** is kept aside while tuning models on the remaining 80%.

🔹 **Pros:** Useful for final model testing.  
🔹 **Cons:** Does not help in model selection.

### **6. Bootstrapping**

✅ **Random sampling with replacement** is used to generate multiple datasets, training the model on each sample.

📌 **Example:** Used in **Random Forests**, where each decision tree is trained on different random subsets of data.

🔹 **Pros:** Works well for small datasets.  
🔹 **Cons:** More variance in results.

### **Final Thoughts**

| **Validation Method**                      | **Best For**                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Train-Test Split**                       | Quick evaluation                   |
| **K-Fold Cross-Validation**                | Reliable performance assessment    |
| **Stratified K-Fold**                      | Imbalanced classification problems |
| **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)** | Small datasets                     |
| **Holdout Validation**                     | Final evaluation                   |
| **Bootstrapping**                          | Small datasets & ensemble models   |

Using **cross-validation techniques** ensures that the model **generalizes well** and prevents issues like **overfitting**. 🚀

## <mark> 8) How does a trained model make predictions on new observations? </mark>

### **How Does a Trained Model Make Predictions on New Observations?**

Once a machine learning model is trained, it can **predict outcomes** for new, unseen data by applying the patterns it has learned. The prediction process follows these key steps:

### **1. Input Features from New Observations**

- The new data (observation) is provided to the model as **feature values** (same format as the training data).
- Example: If predicting house prices, the input could be:
  $$
  \text{Size} = 1500 \text{ sq. ft.}, \quad \text{Bedrooms} = 3, \quad \text{Location} = Urban.
  $$

### **2. Apply the Learned Model Parameters**

- The trained model applies its learned **patterns, weights, or decision rules** to the input.
- The method depends on the model type:

  **For a Linear Regression model:**

  $$
  y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b.
  $$

  The model **multiplies feature values** by the learned weights and adds a bias.

  **For a Decision Tree:**

  - The new observation follows a **series of "if-else" rules** learned during training.
  - Example: _If Size > 1400, then predict price = High._

  **For a Neural Network:**

  - The input is passed through **layers of neurons** and transformed through activations like ReLU or Sigmoid.

### **3. Compute the Output (Prediction)**

- Based on the processed input, the model generates a prediction.
- The output depends on the **type of machine learning task**:

  | **ML Task**        | **Example**                   | **Model Output**                      |
  | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | **Regression**     | Predict house price           | A continuous number (e.g., $250,000)  |
  | **Classification** | Classify email as spam or not | A probability score (e.g., 0.85 Spam) |
  | **Clustering**     | Group customers               | Cluster label (e.g., Customer Type A) |

### **4. Post-Processing & Decision Making**

- **For classification models**, if the model outputs probabilities, they can be converted into class labels using a threshold (e.g., Spam if probability > 0.5).
- **For regression models**, post-processing can include rounding values or applying business rules.

📌 **Example:** A credit risk model assigns a **risk score** → The bank decides whether to approve or deny a loan.

### **Final Thoughts**

✅ A trained model makes predictions by **taking new input, applying learned patterns, and generating an output**.  
✅ The accuracy of predictions depends on **data quality, model training, and feature selection**.  
✅ Continuous monitoring ensures the model adapts to **new patterns** in real-world data. 🚀

## <mark> 10) What is Supervised Learning? How does it work? Explain the differences between Regression and Classification in Supervised Learning. </mark>

### **What is Supervised Learning?**

✅ **Supervised Learning** is a type of **Machine Learning (ML)** where a model is trained on **labeled data**—meaning each input data point has a corresponding **output (target)**. The goal is for the model to learn patterns and make predictions on new, unseen data.

📌 **Example:**

- **Spam Detection:** Emails (input) labeled as **spam or not spam (output)**.
- **House Price Prediction:** Features like **size, location (input)** predict **price (output)**.

### **How Does Supervised Learning Work?**

Supervised Learning follows these **key steps**:

1️⃣ **Collect Labeled Data:**

- Dataset includes **features (X)** and **labels (Y)**.
- Example: In a medical diagnosis dataset, symptoms (X) map to a disease (Y).

2️⃣ **Split Data into Training & Testing Sets:**

- **Training Set (80%)** → Used to teach the model.
- **Testing Set (20%)** → Used to evaluate performance.

3️⃣ **Choose an Algorithm:**

- Regression (if output is continuous) → **Linear Regression, Decision Trees**
- Classification (if output is categorical) → **Logistic Regression, Random Forest**

4️⃣ **Train the Model:**

- The model learns patterns from the **training data** by minimizing errors.
- Uses optimization techniques like **Gradient Descent**.

5️⃣ **Evaluate & Fine-Tune:**

- Test on unseen data, adjust hyperparameters, and improve accuracy.

### **Regression vs. Classification in Supervised Learning**

| **Feature**            | **Regression**                                     | **Classification**                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**         | Predicts **continuous values**                     | Predicts **categorical labels**         |
| **Output Type**        | Continuous (e.g., 0 to 100)                        | Discrete categories (e.g., Yes/No)      |
| **Examples**           | Predicting house prices, stock prices              | Spam detection, Disease diagnosis       |
| **Common Algorithms**  | Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | Mean Squared Error (MSE), R²-score                 | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score   |

📌 **Example:**

- **Regression:** Predicting a car’s **resale value ($20,000, $25,000, etc.)**.

## <mark> 11) What is a Naïve Bayes classifier? Explain it in the context of the case study on handwritten digit recognition. </mark>

### **What is a Naïve Bayes Classifier?**

✅ **Naïve Bayes** is a **probabilistic classification algorithm** based on **Bayes' Theorem**, assuming that **features are independent** given the class label. It is widely used in **text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and handwritten digit recognition**.

📌 **Bayes' Theorem:**

$$
P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X|Y) P(Y)}{P(X)}
$$

where:

- $P(Y|X)$ → Probability of class $Y$ given input $X$ (**Posterior Probability**)
- $P(X|Y)$ → Likelihood of input $X$ given class $Y$
- $P(Y)$ → Prior probability of class $Y$
- $P(X)$ → Overall probability of input $X$

**"Naïve" Assumption:** All features are **independent**, making computation simpler.

### **Naïve Bayes for Handwritten Digit Recognition**

Handwritten digit recognition is a classification problem where the goal is to classify **handwritten digits (0-9) based on pixel values**.

🔹 **Step 1: Dataset Preparation**

- **Dataset:** MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) contains **28×28 grayscale images** of handwritten digits.
- **Features:** Each pixel’s intensity (0 to 255) is treated as a feature.
- **Labels:** The digits (0 to 9) are the classes.

🔹 **Step 2: Training the Naïve Bayes Model**

1. Convert grayscale images into **binary values (0 for white, 1 for black)** to simplify the model.
2. Compute **probabilities for each pixel** in different digits using Bayes' theorem.
3. Assume **each pixel is independent** (Naïve assumption).

🔹 **Step 3: Making Predictions**

- For a new digit image, the model calculates the probability of it belonging to each digit (0-9).
- It assigns the digit with the **highest probability** as the predicted class.

### **Advantages of Naïve Bayes in Digit Recognition**

✅ **Fast & Efficient:** Works well even with large datasets like MNIST.  
✅ **Low Computational Cost:** Requires fewer resources than deep learning models.  
✅ **Handles Noisy Data:** Performs well despite minor variations in handwriting.

📌 **Example:**  
If a new handwritten digit is fed into the model, and it finds:

$$
P(3 | X) = 0.72, \quad P(5 | X) = 0.25, \quad P(7 | X) = 0.03
$$

Then, the model classifies it as **digit 3**, since it has the highest probability.

### **Final Thoughts**

✅ **Naïve Bayes is a simple but effective classifier** for **handwritten digit recognition**.  
✅ **Though deep learning (CNNs) outperforms it**, Naïve Bayes remains a **fast and interpretable choice** for classification problems. 🚀

## <mark> 13) Explain linear regression with suitable examples for supervised learning. </mark>

### **Linear Regression in Supervised Learning**

✅ **Linear Regression** is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for predicting **continuous numerical values** based on the relationship between **independent variables (features)** and a **dependent variable (target)**.

📌 **Formula:**

$$
Y = mX + b
$$

where:

- $ Y $ → Predicted value (dependent variable)
- $ X $ → Input feature (independent variable)
- $ m $ → Slope (how much $ Y $ changes when $ X $ changes)
- $ b $ → Intercept (value of $ Y $ when $ X = 0 $)

For **multiple features**, the equation extends to:

$$
Y = w_1X_1 + w_2X_2 + ... + w_nX_n + b
$$

### **How Linear Regression Works in Supervised Learning**

1️⃣ **Collect Labeled Data** → Dataset contains **features (X) and target (Y)**.  
2️⃣ **Train the Model** → The model **learns the best-fit line** by minimizing error (using techniques like **Least Squares**).  
3️⃣ **Make Predictions** → Given new input $X$, the model predicts $Y$ using the learned function.

### **Examples of Linear Regression in Supervised Learning**

🔹 **Example 1: Predicting House Prices**

- **Features (X):** Size of the house (sq. ft.), Number of bedrooms, Location.
- **Target (Y):** House Price.
- **Model:** Learns the relationship between house size and price to predict **new house prices**.

🔹 **Example 2: Predicting Salary Based on Experience**

- **Features (X):** Years of experience.
- **Target (Y):** Salary.
- **Model Output:** A straight-line equation predicting salary from experience.

✅ **Visualization:**

- The model fits a **best-fit line** on a scatter plot of **experience vs. salary**.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Years of Experience
y = np.array([30000, 35000, 40000, 45000, 50000])  # Salary

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)  # Train model
prediction = model.predict([[6]])  # Predict salary for 6 years experience
print(prediction)  # Expected output ~ 55000
```

### **Advantages of Linear Regression**

✅ **Simple & Interpretable** → Easy to understand and implement.  
✅ **Computationally Efficient** → Works well for small to medium-sized datasets.  
✅ **Good for Linearly Related Data** → Performs well when data follows a linear trend.

### **Final Thoughts**

✅ **Linear Regression is a foundational supervised learning algorithm** used in **prediction tasks** where the target variable is **continuous**. It is widely applied in **finance, healthcare, and marketing analytics**. 🚀

## <mark> 14) How can a confusion matrix help evaluate the performance of a classification model? </mark>

### **Confusion Matrix in Evaluating Classification Models**

✅ A **Confusion Matrix** is a performance measurement tool for **classification models**. It shows how well a model predicts actual categories by comparing **predicted vs. actual values**.

### **1. Structure of a Confusion Matrix**

| **Actual / Predicted**  | **Positive (1) Prediction** | **Negative (0) Prediction** |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Positive (1) Actual** | **True Positive (TP)**      | **False Negative (FN)**     |
| **Negative (0) Actual** | **False Positive (FP)**     | **True Negative (TN)**      |

📌 **Definitions:**

- **True Positive (TP)** → Model correctly predicts a **positive class**.
- **True Negative (TN)** → Model correctly predicts a **negative class**.
- **False Positive (FP) (Type I Error)** → Model incorrectly predicts **positive** when it’s actually **negative**.
- **False Negative (FN) (Type II Error)** → Model incorrectly predicts **negative** when it’s actually **positive**.

### **2. How Confusion Matrix Helps Evaluate Performance**

🔹 **Accuracy:**

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
$$

✅ **Shows overall correctness** but is unreliable for **imbalanced datasets**.

🔹 **Precision (Positive Predictive Value):**

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
$$

✅ **Useful when False Positives (FP) are costly**, like in spam detection.

🔹 **Recall (Sensitivity / True Positive Rate):**

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
$$

✅ **Useful when False Negatives (FN) are costly**, like in medical diagnoses.

🔹 **F1-Score (Balanced measure of Precision & Recall):**

$$
\text{F1-score} = \frac{2 \times \text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$

✅ **Best for imbalanced datasets.**

🔹 **Specificity (True Negative Rate):**

$$
\text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}
$$

✅ **Important for fraud detection to reduce false alarms.**

### **3. Example Confusion Matrix in Python**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Actual labels
y_pred = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]  # Predicted labels

cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
print(cm)
```

🔹 **Output Example:**

```
[[3 1]
 [1 5]]
```

- 3 True Negatives (TN)
- 1 False Positive (FP)
- 1 False Negative (FN)
- 5 True Positives (TP)

### **4. When to Use the Confusion Matrix?**

✅ **Binary Classification** (Spam vs. Not Spam).  
✅ **Multi-Class Classification** (Classifying diseases).  
✅ **Imbalanced Datasets** (Fraud detection, Medical diagnosis).

### **Final Thoughts**

✅ **The Confusion Matrix provides deeper insights than just accuracy.**  
✅ **Metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score help in model selection.**  
✅ **It helps in minimizing critical errors (false positives/false negatives).** 🚀

## <mark> 15) What role does principal component analysis (PCA) play in unsupervised learning? OR How does PCA help in reducing input variables while maintaining important information? </mark>

### **Role of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Unsupervised Learning**

✅ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a **dimensionality reduction technique** used in **unsupervised learning** to reduce the number of input features while **retaining the most important information**. It transforms the original variables into a new set of **uncorrelated components (Principal Components)** that capture the maximum variance in the data.

📌 **Example Use Cases:**

- **Reducing high-dimensional datasets** (e.g., compressing images in facial recognition).
- **Visualizing complex data** (e.g., plotting multi-featured data in 2D/3D).
- **Speeding up machine learning models** by eliminating redundant features.

### **How Does PCA Reduce Input Variables While Keeping Important Information?**

🔹 **Step 1: Standardize the Data**

- Convert all features to the **same scale** (mean = 0, variance = 1) to ensure fair comparison.

🔹 **Step 2: Compute the Covariance Matrix**

- Measures the relationship between different features to identify **correlated features**.

🔹 **Step 3: Compute Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**

- **Eigenvalues** show the amount of variance captured by each component.
- **Eigenvectors** define the direction of new features (**Principal Components**).

🔹 **Step 4: Select Principal Components**

- Rank components by variance (higher variance = more important).
- Keep **only the top k components** that explain most of the variance.

🔹 **Step 5: Transform Data to New Space**

- Project the original data onto the **selected principal components** (fewer dimensions).

📌 **Example:**  
A dataset has **100 features**, but **PCA finds that 5 components** capture **95% of the variance**. Instead of using all 100 features, we keep only **5**, reducing complexity while preserving essential information.

### **Benefits of PCA in Machine Learning**

✅ **Reduces Dimensionality** → Fewer features mean **faster computation** and **less overfitting**.  
✅ **Removes Multicollinearity** → Eliminates redundant, highly correlated features.  
✅ **Improves Visualization** → Converts complex data into 2D/3D for easier interpretation.  
✅ **Enhances Model Performance** → Helps classifiers focus on the most relevant features.

📌 **Real-World Example:**  
In **handwritten digit recognition**, PCA helps reduce **784 pixel features** (28×28 images) to **50 principal components**, maintaining accuracy while speeding up computations.

### **Final Thoughts**

✅ **PCA is a powerful tool for feature reduction in unsupervised learning**.  
✅ **It helps simplify models, improve efficiency, and retain critical data patterns**.  
✅ **Used in image processing, finance, biology, and recommendation systems**. 🚀

### **What are Clustering Algorithms?**

✅ **Clustering algorithms** are **unsupervised learning techniques** used to group similar data points into clusters based on patterns or similarities.  
✅ Unlike classification, clustering works **without labeled data**, making it useful for **data exploration and pattern discovery**.

### **Applications of Clustering in Data Science**

📌 **1. Customer Segmentation**

- Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior to improve marketing strategies.

### **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**

✅ **K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms**.  
✅ It partitions data into **K clusters**, where each data point belongs to the **nearest cluster centroid**.

### **Steps of K-Means Algorithm**

1️⃣ **Choose the number of clusters (K)** → Predefine the number of clusters.

2️⃣ **Initialize centroids randomly** → Select K points as initial cluster centers.

3️⃣ **Assign each data point to the nearest centroid** → Based on **Euclidean distance**.

4️⃣ **Recalculate centroids** → Compute the **mean of all points** in each cluster.

5️⃣ **Repeat steps 3 and 4** until centroids **no longer change** (convergence).

📌 **Mathematical Formula (Euclidean Distance Calculation):**

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

where $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $ are data points.

### **Example of K-Means Clustering in Python**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Sample data points (X, Y coordinates)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 3], [5, 7], [6, 8], [7, 8]])

# Apply K-Means clustering with 2 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Plot clusters
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s=200, marker='X', color='red')
plt.show()
```

✅ **Output:** Two distinct clusters with red **centroids**.

### **Advantages of K-Means Clustering**

✔ **Simple and Fast** → Works well with large datasets.  
✔ **Scalable** → Handles high-dimensional data efficiently.  
✔ **Works well for spherical clusters** → Suitable for simple datasets.

### **Limitations of K-Means**

❌ **Needs to predefine K** → Choosing the wrong K can lead to poor clustering.  
❌ **Sensitive to Outliers** → Outliers can distort centroids.  
❌ **Doesn’t work well for non-spherical clusters** → Struggles with irregular shapes.

### **Final Thoughts**

✅ **Clustering algorithms help discover hidden patterns in data.**  
✅ **K-Means is a widely used method for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image processing.**  
✅ **Choosing the right number of clusters (K) is critical for better performance.** 🚀

## <mark> 17) What are the key evaluation metrics for classification and regression models? Provide examples. </mark>

#### **Key Evaluation Metrics for Classification and Regression Models**

## <mark> 18) Given house price data: </mark>

| Area (sq. ft.) | Price (₹ in Lakhs) |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1000           | 50                 |
| 1500           | 70                 |
| 2000           | 90                 |
| 2500           | 110                |

<mark> Predict the price for a 1750 sq. ft. house using KNN regression with K=2. </mark>

Using KNN regression with K = 2, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate distances:**  
   For the new area 1750 sq. ft., compute the absolute difference to each training observation:

   - |1750 - 1000| = 750
   - |1750 - 1500| = 250
   - |1750 - 2000| = 250
   - |1750 - 2500| = 750

2. **Identify the 2 nearest neighbors:**  
   The smallest distances (250) are from houses with areas 1500 and 2000 sq. ft.

3. **Find their prices:**

   - House with 1500 sq. ft. has price ₹70 lakhs.
   - House with 2000 sq. ft. has price ₹90 lakhs.

4. **Predict by averaging:**
   $$
   \text{Predicted Price} = \frac{70 + 90}{2} = 80 \text{ lakhs}
   $$

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted price for a 1750 sq. ft. house is **₹80 lakhs**.

## <mark> 19) Given the dataset of house prices: </mark>

| Area (sq. ft.) | Price (₹ in Lakhs) |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1000           | 50                 |
| 1500           | 75                 |
| 2000           | 100                |

<mark> Find the linear regression equation (y = mx + c) and predict the price of a 1250 sq. ft. house.
</mark>

Let's determine the linear regression equation $ y = mx + c $ using the given data points:

| Area (sq.ft.) | Price (₹ in Lakhs) |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1000          | 50                 |
| 1500          | 75                 |
| 2000          | 100                |

### **Step 1: Calculate the Slope (m)**

Using any two points, for example, $(1000,50)$ and $(1500,75)$:

$$
m = \frac{75 - 50}{1500 - 1000} = \frac{25}{500} = 0.05.
$$

### **Step 2: Calculate the Intercept (c)**

Using the point $(1000, 50)$:

$$
50 = 0.05 \times 1000 + c \quad \Rightarrow \quad 50 = 50 + c \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = 0.
$$

### **Regression Equation**

The equation is:

$$
y = 0.05x.
$$

### **Step 3: Predict the Price for a 1250 sq.ft. House**

Substitute $ x = 1250 $:

$$
y = 0.05 \times 1250 = 62.5.
$$

**Final Answer:**  
The linear regression equation is $ y = 0.05x $, and the predicted price for a 1250 sq.ft. house is **₹62.5 lakhs**.

## <mark> 20) A company’s advertisement spending (₹ Lakhs) and sales revenue (₹ Crores) is given below: </mark>

| Ad Spend (₹ Lakhs) | Sales Revenue (₹ Crores) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1                  | 10                       |
| 2                  | 20                       |
| 3                  | 30                       |

<mark> Fit a linear regression model and estimate the sales revenue if the ad spend is 2.5 Lakhs. </mark>

Given the data:

| **Ad Spend (₹ Lakhs)** | **Sales Revenue (₹ Crores)** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1                      | 10                           |
| 2                      | 20                           |
| 3                      | 30                           |
| 4                      | 40                           |

We can see that the relationship is perfectly linear.

### **Step 1: Determine the Linear Regression Model**

We want an equation in the form:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

Using the points, let’s compute the slope (m) using any two points (for example, (1, 10) and (2, 20)):

$$
m = \frac{20 - 10}{2 - 1} = \frac{10}{1} = 10.
$$

Next, to find the intercept (c), plug in one of the points (using (1, 10)):

$$
10 = 10 \times 1 + c \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = 10 - 10 = 0.
$$

Thus, the regression equation is:

$$
y = 10x,
$$

where:

- $x$ = Ad Spend (in Lakhs)
- $y$ = Sales Revenue (in Crores)

### **Step 2: Estimate Sales Revenue for Ad Spend of 2.5 Lakhs**

Substitute $ x = 2.5 $ into the equation:

$$
y = 10 \times 2.5 = 25.
$$

### **Final Answer**

The estimated sales revenue for an ad spend of **2.5 Lakhs** is **₹25 Crores**.

## <mark> 21) Given student study hours and exam scores: </mark>

| Hours Studied | Score |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 2             | 50    |
| 4             | 60    |
| 6             | 70    |
| 8             | 80    |

<mark> Calculate the linear regression equation and predict the score for a student who studies 5 hours. </mark>

Using the given data:

| Hours Studied | Exam Score |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 2             | 50         |
| 4             | 60         |
| 6             | 70         |
| 8             | 80         |

We first calculate the linear regression equation in the form:

$$
y = mx + c,
$$

where:

- $ y $ is the exam score,
- $ x $ is the number of study hours,
- $ m $ is the slope,
- $ c $ is the intercept.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Slope (m)**

Using any two points, for example, (2, 50) and (4, 60):

$$
m = \frac{60 - 50}{4 - 2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5.
$$

### **Step 2: Calculate the Intercept (c)**

Use one of the points (for example, (2, 50)):

$$
50 = 5 \times 2 + c \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = 50 - 10 = 40.
$$

### **Regression Equation**

The linear regression equation is:

$$
y = 5x + 40.
$$

### **Step 3: Predict the Score for a Student Who Studies 5 Hours**

Substitute $ x = 5 $ into the equation:

$$
y = 5 \times 5 + 40 = 25 + 40 = 65.
$$

### **Final Answer**

The linear regression equation is:

$$
\boxed{y = 5x + 40}
$$

and the predicted exam score for a student who studies 5 hours is **65**.

## <mark> 22) A company records employee experience and salary: </mark>

| Experience (Years) | Salary (₹ Lakhs) |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1                  | 3                |
| 3                  | 6                |
| 5                  | 9                |

<mark> Find the regression equation and predict the salary for an employee with 4 years of experience. </mark>

Given the data:

| Experience (Years) | Salary (₹ Lakhs) |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1                  | 3                |
| 3                  | 6                |
| 5                  | 9                |

We need to derive the linear regression equation in the form:

$$
y = mx + c,
$$

where:

- $y$ is the Salary,
- $x$ is the Experience,
- $m$ is the slope,
- $c$ is the intercept.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Means**

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1 + 3 + 5}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3,
$$

$$
\bar{y} = \frac{3 + 6 + 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6.
$$

### **Step 2: Calculate the Slope (m)**

The slope $m$ is given by:

$$
m = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}.
$$

For each data point:

- For $x=1$:  
  $x - \bar{x} = 1 - 3 = -2$  
  $y - \bar{y} = 3 - 6 = -3$  
  Product: $(-2) \times (-3) = 6$.

- For $x=3$:  
  $x - \bar{x} = 3 - 3 = 0$  
  $y - \bar{y} = 6 - 6 = 0$  
  Product: $0 \times 0 = 0$.

- For $x=5$:  
  $x - \bar{x} = 5 - 3 = 2$  
  $y - \bar{y} = 9 - 6 = 3$  
  Product: $2 \times 3 = 6$.

Now, sum up these products:

$$
\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = 6 + 0 + 6 = 12.
$$

Next, compute the sum of squares for $x$:

- For $x=1$: $(1 - 3)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$.
- For $x=3$: $(3 - 3)^2 = 0^2 = 0$.
- For $x=5$: $(5 - 3)^2 = (2)^2 = 4$.

$$
\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 4 + 0 + 4 = 8.
$$

So, the slope is:

$$
m = \frac{12}{8} = 1.5.
$$

### **Step 3: Calculate the Intercept (c)**

The intercept $c$ is calculated by:

$$
c = \bar{y} - m\bar{x} = 6 - 1.5 \times 3 = 6 - 4.5 = 1.5.
$$

### **Regression Equation**

The regression equation is:

$$
\boxed{y = 1.5x + 1.5}
$$

### **Step 4: Predict the Salary for 4 Years of Experience**

For $x = 4$ years:

$$
y = 1.5 \times 4 + 1.5 = 6 + 1.5 = 7.5.
$$

Thus, the predicted salary for an employee with 4 years of experience is **₹7.5 Lakhs**.

## <mark> 23) A dataset has two categories: Spam and Not Spam. Given the following probabilities: <br> P(Spam) = 0.4, P(Not Spam) = 0.6 <br> P(Word1 | Spam) = 0.2, P(Word1 | Not Spam) = 0.5 <br> P(Word2 | Spam) = 0.6, P(Word2 | Not Spam) = 0.3 <br> Calculate the probability that a new email containing Word1 and Word2 is Spam. </mark>

We can use Bayes' theorem with the naïve assumption that the words occur independently given the class. The formula for the posterior probability is:

$$
P(\text{Spam} | \text{Word1}, \text{Word2}) = \frac{P(\text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word1} | \text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word2} | \text{Spam})}{P(\text{Word1}, \text{Word2})}
$$

First, compute the numerator:

$$
P(\text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word1} | \text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word2} | \text{Spam}) = 0.4 \times 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.048.
$$

Next, the total probability of observing Word1 and Word2 is:

$$
P(\text{Word1}, \text{Word2}) = P(\text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word1} | \text{Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word2} | \text{Spam}) + P(\text{Not Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word1} | \text{Not Spam}) \cdot P(\text{Word2} | \text{Not Spam}).
$$

Substitute the given values:

$$
P(\text{Word1}, \text{Word2}) = 0.4 \times 0.2 \times 0.6 + 0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.048 + 0.09 = 0.138.
$$

Now, plug these into Bayes' formula:

$$
P(\text{Spam} | \text{Word1}, \text{Word2}) = \frac{0.048}{0.138} \approx 0.3478.
$$

**Final Answer:**  
The probability that a new email containing Word1 and Word2 is Spam is approximately **34.78%** (about 35%).

## <mark> 24) In a medical dataset, a person’s likelihood of having a disease is based on symptoms: <br> P(Disease) = 0.1, P(No Disease) = 0.9 <br> P(Fever | Disease) = 0.8, P(Fever | No Disease) = 0.3 <br> P(Cough | Disease) = 0.7, P(Cough | No Disease) = 0.4 <br> If a new patient has Fever and Cough, calculate the probability that they have the disease. </mark>

We can calculate the probability that the new patient has the disease using Bayes’ theorem with the naïve assumption (i.e. assuming that the symptoms are conditionally independent given the disease status).

Given:

- $P(\text{Disease}) = 0.1$
- $P(\text{No Disease}) = 0.9$
- $P(\text{Fever} \mid \text{Disease}) = 0.8$
- $P(\text{Fever} \mid \text{No Disease}) = 0.3$
- $P(\text{Cough} \mid \text{Disease}) = 0.7$
- $P(\text{Cough} \mid \text{No Disease}) = 0.4$

**Step 1: Compute the likelihoods for both conditions**

- For a patient with the disease:

  $$
  P(\text{Fever, Cough} \mid \text{Disease}) = P(\text{Fever} \mid \text{Disease}) \times P(\text{Cough} \mid \text{Disease}) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56.
  $$

- For a patient without the disease:
  $$
  P(\text{Fever, Cough} \mid \text{No Disease}) = P(\text{Fever} \mid \text{No Disease}) \times P(\text{Cough} \mid \text{No Disease}) = 0.3 \times 0.4 = 0.12.
  $$

**Step 2: Use Bayes’ Theorem**

Bayes’ theorem tells us:

$$
P(\text{Disease} \mid \text{Fever, Cough}) = \frac{P(\text{Fever, Cough} \mid \text{Disease}) \, P(\text{Disease})}{P(\text{Fever, Cough})},
$$

where

$$
P(\text{Fever, Cough}) = P(\text{Fever, Cough} \mid \text{Disease}) \, P(\text{Disease}) + P(\text{Fever, Cough} \mid \text{No Disease}) \, P(\text{No Disease}).
$$

Plug in the values:

$$
P(\text{Fever, Cough}) = 0.56 \times 0.1 + 0.12 \times 0.9 = 0.056 + 0.108 = 0.164.
$$

Now, compute the posterior probability:

$$
P(\text{Disease} \mid \text{Fever, Cough}) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.1}{0.164} = \frac{0.056}{0.164} \approx 0.3415.
$$

**Final Answer:**

The probability that the patient has the disease, given they have both Fever and Cough, is approximately **34.15%**.

## <mark> 25) Given the following dataset with two features (X1, X2) and class labels: </mark>

| X1  | X2  | Class |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 1   | 1   | A     |
| 2   | 2   | A     |

| 6   | 6   | B     |

<mark> Using KNN with K=3, classify a new data point (4,4). </mark>

To classify the new data point $(4,4)$ using KNN with $K=3$, we first compute the Euclidean distances between $(4,4)$ and each point in the dataset:

1. **Distance to (1,1), Class A:**

$$
d = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (4-1)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9+9} = \sqrt{18} \approx 4.24.
$$

2. **Distance to (2,2), Class A:**

$$
d = \sqrt{(4-2)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{4+4} = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.83.
$$

3. **Distance to (3,3), Class B:**

$$
d = \sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (4-3)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41.
$$

4. **Distance to (6,6), Class B:**

$$
d = \sqrt{(4-6)^2 + (4-6)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4+4} = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.83.
$$

Now, order the distances:

- $(3,3)$ with $ \approx 1.41 $ (Class B)
- $(2,2)$ with $ \approx 2.83 $ (Class A)
- $(6,6)$ with $ \approx 2.83 $ (Class B)
- $(1,1)$ with $ \approx 4.24 $ (Class A)

Taking the 3 nearest neighbors (K = 3), we have:

- $(3,3)$: Class B
- $(2,2)$: Class A
- $(6,6)$: Class B

The majority class among these neighbors is **B** (2 out of 3).

**Final Answer:**  
The new data point $(4,4)$ is classified as **Class B**.

## <mark> 26) You have a dataset of fruits classified based on their weight and size. </mark>

| Weight (g) | Size (cm) | Fruit Type |

| 150        | 8         | Apple      |
| 180        | 10        | Apple      |
| 200        | 12        | Orange     |
| 220        | 14        | Orange     |

<mark> Classify a fruit with weight 190g and size 11cm using KNN (K=3). </mark>

To classify the new fruit using KNN with $K=3$, we follow these steps:

### **Step 1: List the Data Points**

| Fruit Type | Weight (g) | Size (cm) |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Apple      | 150        | 8         |
| Apple      | 180        | 10        |
| Orange     | 200        | 12        |
| Orange     | 220        | 14        |

New fruit: Weight = 190 g, Size = 11 cm

### **Step 2: Compute Euclidean Distances**

The Euclidean distance between two points $(w_1, s_1)$ and $(w_2, s_2)$ is:

$$
d = \sqrt{(w_2 - w_1)^2 + (s_2 - s_1)^2}.
$$

1. **Distance to (150, 8) [Apple]:**

   $$
   d = \sqrt{(190-150)^2 + (11-8)^2} = \sqrt{40^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 9} = \sqrt{1609} \approx 40.12.
   $$

2. **Distance to (180, 10) [Apple]:**

   $$
   d = \sqrt{(190-180)^2 + (11-10)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{100 + 1} = \sqrt{101} \approx 10.05.
   $$

3. **Distance to (200, 12) [Orange]:**

   $$
   d = \sqrt{(190-200)^2 + (11-12)^2} = \sqrt{(-10)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 1} = \sqrt{101} \approx 10.05.
   $$

4. **Distance to (220, 14) [Orange]:**
   $$
   d = \sqrt{(190-220)^2 + (11-14)^2} = \sqrt{(-30)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{900 + 9} = \sqrt{909} \approx 30.15.
   $$

### **Step 3: Identify the 3 Nearest Neighbors**

Order the distances:

- (180, 10) [Apple]: $\approx 10.05$
- (200, 12) [Orange]: $\approx 10.05$
- (220, 14) [Orange]: $\approx 30.15$
- (150, 8) [Apple]: $\approx 40.12$

The 3 nearest neighbors are:

- **(180, 10)** → Apple
- **(200, 12)** → Orange
- **(220, 14)** → Orange

### **Step 4: Classify by Majority Vote**

Among the 3 nearest neighbors:

- Apple: 1
- Orange: 2

The majority class is **Orange**.

### **Final Answer**

The new fruit with a weight of 190 g and a size of 11 cm is classified as **Orange** using KNN with $K=3$.

## <mark> 27) A dataset provides the exam scores of students based on study hours: </mark>

| Hours Studied | Exam Score |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 1             | 45         |
| 2             | 50         |
| 3             | 55         |
| 4             | 60         |
| 5             | 65         |

<mark> Predict the score for a student who studies 3.5 hours using KNN regression with K=3. </mark>

**Step 1: Compute the Distances**

For the new point $(3.5)$ (i.e., 3.5 hours), calculate the absolute distance from each data point:

- For 1 hour (score = 45):  
  $|3.5 - 1| = 2.5$
- For 2 hours (score = 50):  
  $|3.5 - 2| = 1.5$
- For 3 hours (score = 55):  
  $|3.5 - 3| = 0.5$
- For 4 hours (score = 60):  
  $|3.5 - 4| = 0.5$
- For 5 hours (score = 65):  
  $|5 - 3.5| = 1.5$

**Step 2: Identify the 3 Nearest Neighbors**

Sorting by distance, we have:

- 0.5: (3 hours, 55) and (4 hours, 60)
- 1.5: (2 hours, 50) and (5 hours, 65)

With $K = 3$, we choose the three closest points. If a tie occurs for the third position, many implementations break ties by order of appearance. Given the dataset order:

1. (3, 55)
2. (4, 60)
3. (2, 50) (comes before (5,65) in the dataset)

**Step 3: Predict the Score**

Calculate the average score of the three nearest neighbors:

$$
\text{Predicted Score} = \frac{55 + 60 + 50}{3} = \frac{165}{3} = 55.
$$

**Final Answer:**  
Using KNN regression with $K=3$, the predicted exam score for a student who studies 3.5 hours is **55**.
