- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is faster and more efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. However, it requires secure key distribution. AES is an example.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is slower but offers enhanced security as the private key is kept secret. It is used for secure key exchange and digital signatures. RSA and ECC are examples.

For IoT applications, **symmetric encryption is often preferred for bulk data encryption due to its speed and efficiency**, considering the limited processing power and memory of many IoT devices. **Asymmetric encryption is used for secure key exchange and authentication**.

## <mark> 14) Hash Functions and Data Integrity </mark>

Hash functions are one-way mathematical algorithms that transform data into a fixed-size string (hash value). They help ensure data integrity by being sensitive to changes; even a tiny alteration in the input data results in a completely different hash value. This allows for easy detection of alterations by comparing the hash values of the original and potentially modified data. Hash functions are used in digital signatures, password storage, and data integrity checks.

## <mark> 15) Code Signing in Secure IoT Software Development </mark>

Code signing is a security practice that uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of software. It involves applying a unique digital signature to software using cryptographic algorithms, validating the author or publisher, and ensuring the file hasn't been tampered with since signing.

It is crucial for secure IoT software development because it ensures the software running on a device is the original, unmodified version, preventing malicious code injection. It protects against tampering during updates, builds trust between stakeholders, improves overall security, and facilitates secure and reliable software updates.

## <mark> 20) How DTLS Enhances Security in CoAP-based IoT Applications </mark>

DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) enhances security in CoAP-based IoT applications by providing a secure communication channel over UDP. This is crucial because CoAP runs over UDP, which is prone to packet spoofing and replay attacks. DTLS encrypts data and uses cryptographic mechanisms to protect against eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission. It also uses certificates to authenticate devices and establish session security. DTLS is a lightweight protocol, making it suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices.
