# About me and this website

## Some useless info about me.

#### I am a student of Computer Engineering Department at Indus University, Ahmedabad, with some interest in Web Development, CyberSecurity, Ethical Hacking and Computer Forensics.

#### Name : Umm, Let's not talk about it ...

## History of this project.

#### This website was initially created for our group of 5 friends, but later on, found useful for all peers, then I decided to publish it and gave it polished look with some useful functionalities.

## Current and Future of this website :

This website will remain ALWAYS FREE. Which does not mean that I do not know how to implement payment gateways or anything, but from the very first day, I decided to keep this project free forever.

The website may change as per the requirements (Like changing the technology, or UI, or anything).

As I am the only owner of this website, all the decisions are made by me only. However you can suggest any changes by filling form under [LINKS](../links) section.
