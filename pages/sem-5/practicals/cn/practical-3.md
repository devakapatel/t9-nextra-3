### AIM: 
To study different types of transmission media.

**Transmission media** provide the physical path between the transmitter and receiver, acting as the channel through which data is transmitted from one place to another. Transmission media can be broadly classified into **Guided** and **Unguided** media.

### Types of Transmission Media

#### 1. Guided Media
Guided media, also known as bounded media, use physical paths for signal transmission. Key features include high speed, secure data transmission, and suitability for shorter distances. Guided media consists of the following types:

- **Twisted Pair Cable**: 
  Consists of two insulated conductor wires twisted together, commonly bundled in a protective sheath. It is widely used and comes in two types:
  
  - **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**: 
    Commonly used for telephonic applications.
    - **Advantages**: 
      - Least expensive
      - Easy to install
      - High-speed capacity
    - **Disadvantages**:
      - Susceptible to interference
      - Lower performance than STP
      - Limited to short distances due to signal attenuation
      
  - **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)**: 
    Has an additional shielding layer to block interference, suitable for high-speed data transmission in Ethernet networks.
    - **Advantages**:
      - Better performance at higher data rates
      - Reduces crosstalk
      - Faster than UTP
    - **Disadvantages**:
      - More complex to install
      - More expensive
      - Bulky design

- **Coaxial Cable**:
  Features an outer plastic covering and inner insulation, suitable for cable TV and analog television networks.
  - **Types**:
    - **Baseband Transmission**: Single high-speed signal transmission.
    - **Broadband Transmission**: Simultaneous multi-signal transmission.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Durable and easy to install
    - Less affected by noise
    - Supports multiple channels
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - Expensive and bulky
    - Requires grounding for noise prevention
    - Vulnerable to security breaches via physical tampering

- **Optical Fiber Cable**:
  Utilizes light refraction through a glass or plastic core surrounded by cladding. It’s ideal for high-volume data transmission.
  - **Advantages**:
    - High capacity and bandwidth
    - Lightweight with minimal signal loss
    - Immune to electromagnetic interference
    - Corrosion-resistant
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - Expensive and fragile
    - Difficult to install and maintain

#### 2. Unguided Media
Unguided media, or wireless transmission, transmits data without a physical connection, usually through air. It is suitable for longer distances but has lower security.

- **Radio Waves**: 
  Suitable for wide coverage, radio waves can penetrate walls and do not require alignment between antennas. Commonly used for AM/FM radios and cordless phones.
  - **Frequency Range**: 3 KHz – 1 GHz
  - **Applications**:
    - FM radios, television, and cordless phones
  - **Advantages**:
    - Covers large areas
    - Higher transmission rate
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - Susceptible to interference and limited security

- **Microwave**: 
  Requires line-of-sight alignment between the sending and receiving antennas, suitable for long-distance communication, especially over challenging terrains.
  - **Frequency Range**: 1 GHz – 300 GHz
  - **Advantages**:
    - Cheaper than wired cables
    - Useful for communication over oceans and rough terrains
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - Vulnerable to eavesdropping
    - Susceptible to weather disruptions
    - Limited bandwidth

- **Infrared**: 
  Infrared is used for short-range communication, such as TV remotes and device-to-device data transfer within a room.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - High data rate support with minimal interference
    - Infrared signals cannot penetrate walls, ensuring localized security
  - **Advantages**:
    - Secure with low interference
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - Not suitable for outdoor use due to interference from sunlight
