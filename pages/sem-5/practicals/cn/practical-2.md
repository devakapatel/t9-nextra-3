### AIM:

To study different categories of networks.

**Network** enables computers to connect and communicate with one another over various mediums. The main categories of networks—**LAN**, **MAN**, and **WAN**—are designed to cover different geographical areas.

### Categories of Networks

### 1. Local Area Network (LAN)

A LAN is a network that connects computers over a common communication path within a limited area, such as a home, school, library, or office. Key technologies include Ethernet and Wi-Fi, with coverage up to 2 km and high transmission speeds.

- **Advantages:**
    - Fast data transfer rates and high-speed communication.
    - Easy setup and management.
    - Supports peripheral device sharing (e.g., printers, scanners).
    - Increased security and fault tolerance compared to WANs.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Limited geographical coverage.
    - Limited scalability; may require infrastructure upgrades to grow.
    - Performance can degrade with high usage.

### 2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

A MAN connects computers over a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, covering a city or metropolitan area. Technologies include FDDI, CDDI, and ATM, with coverage from 5 km to 50 km.

- **Advantages:**
    - Provides high-speed connectivity over a large area.
    - Can serve as an ISP for multiple users within the coverage area.
    - Sometimes offers higher data transfer rates than WAN.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - High setup and maintenance costs.
    - Performance issues with heavy usage.
    - Generally lower fault tolerance and security compared to LANs.

### 3. Wide Area Network (WAN)

WANs cover vast geographical areas, often connecting multiple LANs across states or countries via telephone lines, radio waves, or satellites. WANs include Switched WAN and Point-to-Point WAN types.

- **Advantages:**
    - Extensive coverage, ideal for remote connections.
    - Provides internet connectivity.
    - Supports remote access to resources and applications.
    - Capable of supporting multiple users and applications simultaneously.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Expensive to establish and maintain.
    - Slower data transfer rates compared to LAN and MAN.
    - Higher latency and propagation delays due to long distances.
    - Lower fault tolerance and security than LANs.

This overview covers the primary characteristics, advantages, and limitations of LAN, MAN, and WAN, helping differentiate network choices based on geographical requirements and performance needs.
