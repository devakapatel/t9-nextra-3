   - Gather raw IoT data from cloud storage and convert it into a structured format.
   - Remove obvious errors such as missing timestamps or duplicated values.

2. **Identify Outliers Using Statistical Methods:**

   - **Z-Score Method:** Measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Any value beyond a threshold (e.g., ±3 standard deviations) is flagged as an outlier.
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:** Data points falling outside 1.5 times the IQR are considered outliers.

3. **Machine Learning Techniques for Outlier Detection:**

   - **Isolation Forest:** An unsupervised ML algorithm that isolates outliers based on decision trees.
   - **Autoencoders:** Deep learning models that reconstruct normal data patterns, identifying anomalies based on reconstruction errors.

4. **Removal or Correction of Outliers:**
   - **Trimming:** Completely removing outliers if they are determined to be errors.
   - **Interpolation:** Replacing outliers with estimated values based on surrounding data points.
   - **Domain-Specific Rules:** Setting upper and lower thresholds based on industry standards.

In a smart energy grid, sudden spikes in power consumption may be due to faulty sensors rather than actual load variations. Detecting and correcting these outliers helps maintain accurate billing and demand forecasting.
