# Unit 4

## 1) Give the difference between memory mapped I/O and peripheral mapped I/O technique.

Memory-mapped I/O and peripheral-mapped I/O (also known as I/O-mapped or port-mapped I/O) are two techniques used to interface with input/output devices in computer systems. Here’s a detailed comparison of the two:

### Memory-Mapped I/O

#### Definition

In memory-mapped I/O, the I/O devices are assigned specific addresses in the same address space as the program memory. This means that both memory and I/O devices can be accessed using the same set of instructions.

#### Characteristics

- Unified Address Space: I/O devices and memory share the same address space, allowing for a larger number of devices to be addressed.
- Instruction Set: Standard memory instructions (like LOAD, STORE) can be used for I/O operations, simplifying the instruction set.
- Addressing: Each I/O device is assigned a unique address in the memory map, and the CPU accesses them using memory addressing techniques.
- Hardware Complexity: It may require more complex hardware and address decoding because both memory and I/O devices share the same address lines.

#### Advantages

- Simplicity of Programming: Programmers can use the same instructions for both memory and I/O operations.
- Faster Access: Direct access to devices can potentially lead to faster data transfer rates.

#### Disadvantages

- Address Space Limitation: Since memory and I/O share the same address space, the total addressable memory is reduced.
- Complexity in System Design: More complex hardware design may be required to manage the unified address space.

### Peripheral-Mapped I/O (I/O-Mapped I/O)

#### Definition

In peripheral-mapped I/O, I/O devices are assigned addresses that are separate from the main memory address space. This technique uses specific I/O instructions to access the devices.

#### Characteristics

- Separate Address Space: I/O devices have their own dedicated address space, distinct from the memory addresses.
- Special Instructions: Specific I/O instructions (like IN and OUT) are used to communicate with the devices, requiring a different set of operations compared to memory access.
- Addressing: Each device is assigned an address in a different range from memory, allowing for dedicated I/O addressing.

#### Advantages

- Larger Addressable Memory: The main memory address space is not reduced because I/O devices use a separate address space.
- Simplicity of I/O Control: Dedicated I/O instructions can simplify the control of devices.

#### Disadvantages

- Additional Instructions Needed: Requires different instructions for I/O operations, which can complicate programming.
- Potentially Slower: Accessing I/O devices can be slower compared to memory-mapped I/O due to the need for different instruction cycles.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature                     | Memory-Mapped I/O                   | Peripheral-Mapped I/O                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Address Space               | Unified (shared with memory)        | Separate (dedicated for I/O)          |
| Instruction Set             | Uses standard memory instructions   | Uses specific I/O instructions        |
| Addressing                  | Memory addressing techniques        | I/O addressing techniques             |
| Hardware Complexity         | More complex due to shared space    | Simpler due to separate spaces        |
| Programming                 | Simpler (same instructions)         | More complex (different instructions) |
| Memory Address Availability | Reduced due to shared I/O addresses | Larger addressable memory space       |

![4-9.png](./4-9.png)

## 10) Multiprocessor and Multiprogramming

### Multiprocessor and Multiprogramming: An Overview

#### Definitions

1. **Multiprocessing**:

   - Multiprocessing refers to the use of two or more processors within a single computer system. These processors can concurrently execute multiple processes, sharing the system's resources, such as memory and I/O devices. Multiprocessing enhances performance by enabling parallel processing, which allows more tasks to be completed in a given time frame.

2. **Multiprogramming**:
   - Multiprogramming is a technique that enables multiple programs to reside in memory at the same time and be executed by a single processor. The operating system manages the execution of these programs, switching between them to maximize CPU utilization. This approach minimizes idle CPU time by ensuring that while one program is waiting for I/O operations to complete, another program can use the CPU.

#### Key Configurations in Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing systems can be categorized into different configurations, primarily:

##### 1. Co-Processor Configuration

- **Description**: In this configuration, the host processor and a co-processor (like the 8087 for floating-point calculations) share the same memory, I/O, bus, and clock generator. The co-processor assists the host in performing complex calculations, effectively offloading work from the main processor.
- **Communication**: The host and co-processor communicate through specific control signals (e.g., TEST, RQ/GT, QS1, QS0), which help manage task execution and resource sharing.

##### 2. Closely Coupled Configuration

- **Description**: Similar to co-processor configurations, closely coupled systems consist of a host processor and independent processors that share memory and I/O resources. However, these independent processors can fetch and execute their own instructions, allowing them to operate autonomously.
- **Communication**: The host processor communicates with the independent processor through shared memory, sending messages that the independent processor can retrieve and act upon.

##### 3. Loosely Coupled Configuration

- **Description**: This configuration consists of several independent modules, each potentially configured as a co-processor or closely coupled system. Each module has its own memory and clock but shares the system bus and I/O.
- **Advantages**: Loosely coupled systems can be expanded modularly, providing high system throughput and fault tolerance, as a failure in one module typically does not disrupt the entire system.

#### Bus Allocation Schemes

In a loosely coupled configuration, multiple modules may attempt to access the shared system bus. Bus control logic is essential for managing access, and several allocation schemes can be employed:

1. **Daisy Chaining**:

   - A simple scheme where all bus masters share a single bus request line. The bus controller grants access sequentially, propagating the bus grant signal until it reaches the requesting bus master.

2. **Polling**:

   - This method involves a bus controller that generates a sequence of addresses in response to bus requests. Each bus master listens for its address to activate the bus. Polling allows dynamic priority adjustments.

3. **Independent Request Scheme**:
   - Each module has its own bus request and grant lines, allowing for parallel resolution of requests. A priority decoder selects the highest priority request for bus access, making this the fastest allocation scheme.

#### Conclusion

Understanding the distinctions between multiprocessing and multiprogramming, along with their configurations and bus allocation schemes, is crucial for computer engineering students and professionals. These concepts are foundational for designing efficient and robust computing systems, particularly in environments requiring high performance and reliability.

## 11) Loosely coupled configuration.

### Definition

A loosely coupled configuration refers to a system architecture in which multiple independent modules (or processors) are connected through a shared system bus, shared memory, and shared I/O devices. Each module has its own local memory and clock, allowing them to function independently while still being able to communicate with one another.

Block Diagram :
![4-11](./4-11.png)

### Characteristics of Loosely Coupled Configuration

1. **Independence**:

   - Each module can operate independently, allowing for parallel processing. This independence means that one module can fail without affecting the entire system.

2. **Shared Resources**:

   - Although each module has its own memory, they share the system bus and input/output (I/O) devices. This shared architecture facilitates communication and data exchange between the modules.

3. **Modular Design**:

   - The loosely coupled configuration is designed to be modular, meaning that additional modules can be added easily to increase system capacity and performance. This makes the architecture scalable for medium to large multiprocessor systems.

4. **Clock Synchronization**:

   - Each module maintains its own clock, but synchronization mechanisms are often implemented to ensure that operations across modules can be coordinated effectively.

5. **High System Throughput**:

   - By allowing multiple modules to operate in parallel, loosely coupled configurations can achieve high throughput, making them suitable for demanding computational tasks.

6. **Bus Arbitration**:
   - Since multiple modules may need to access the shared system bus simultaneously, bus control logic is essential for resolving access conflicts. This typically involves various bus allocation schemes, such as daisy chaining, polling, and independent requesting.

### Advantages of Loosely Coupled Configuration

- **Fault Tolerance**: The failure of one module typically does not disrupt the operation of the overall system, enhancing reliability.
- **Scalability**: New modules can be added without significant redesign, making it easy to expand system capabilities.
- **Specialization**: Modules can be specialized to perform different tasks, optimizing resource usage.

## 12) Bus allocation schemes.

### Bus Allocation Schemes

In a loosely coupled configuration, several bus masters may attempt to access the shared system bus. Common bus allocation schemes include:

1. **Daisy Chaining**:

   - A simple method where all bus masters share a single bus request line. The bus controller grants access sequentially, propagating the bus grant signal until it reaches the first requesting bus master.

2. **Polling**:

   - A bus controller generates a sequence of addresses in response to bus requests. Each bus master listens for its address; upon recognition, it activates the busy line to begin using the bus. This method allows dynamic priority adjustments.

3. **Independent Request Scheme**:
   - Each module has its own bus request and grant lines, allowing for parallel resolution of requests. A priority decoder selects the highest priority request for bus access, making this scheme the fastest among the three.
