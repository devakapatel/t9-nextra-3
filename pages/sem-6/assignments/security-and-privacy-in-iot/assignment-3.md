- **Ensuring confidentiality:** Encryption is a primary method for maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information.

**Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption**

Here's a comparison of symmetric and asymmetric encryption:

- **Symmetric Encryption:**
  - Uses the **same key** for both encryption and decryption.
  - It is generally **faster** and more efficient than asymmetric encryption.
  - Key distribution can be a challenge, as the key must be securely shared between parties.
  - Examples include AES.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:**
  - Uses **two different keys:** a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
  - The public key can be freely distributed, while the private key must be kept secret.
  - It simplifies key distribution but is generally **slower** than symmetric encryption.
  - Examples include RSA.
