# Unit 4

# 8) Give the difference between memory mapped I/O and peripheral mapped I/O technique.

Memory-mapped I/O and peripheral-mapped I/O (also known as I/O-mapped or port-mapped I/O) are two techniques used to interface with input/output devices in computer systems. Here’s a detailed comparison of the two:

## Memory-Mapped I/O

### Definition
In memory-mapped I/O, the I/O devices are assigned specific addresses in the same address space as the program memory. This means that both memory and I/O devices can be accessed using the same set of instructions.

### Characteristics
- **Unified Address Space**: I/O devices and memory share the same address space, allowing for a larger number of devices to be addressed.
- **Instruction Set**: Standard memory instructions (like LOAD, STORE) can be used for I/O operations, simplifying the instruction set.
- **Addressing**: Each I/O device is assigned a unique address in the memory map, and the CPU accesses them using memory addressing techniques.
- **Hardware Complexity**: It may require more complex hardware and address decoding because both memory and I/O devices share the same address lines.

### Advantages
- **Simplicity of Programming**: Programmers can use the same instructions for both memory and I/O operations.
- **Faster Access**: Direct access to devices can potentially lead to faster data transfer rates.
  
### Disadvantages
- **Address Space Limitation**: Since memory and I/O share the same address space, the total addressable memory is reduced.
- **Complexity in System Design**: More complex hardware design may be required to manage the unified address space.

## Peripheral-Mapped I/O (I/O-Mapped I/O)

### Definition
In peripheral-mapped I/O, I/O devices are assigned addresses that are separate from the main memory address space. This technique uses specific I/O instructions to access the devices.

### Characteristics
- **Separate Address Space**: I/O devices have their own dedicated address space, distinct from the memory addresses.
- **Special Instructions**: Specific I/O instructions (like IN and OUT) are used to communicate with the devices, requiring a different set of operations compared to memory access.
- **Addressing**: Each device is assigned an address in a different range from memory, allowing for dedicated I/O addressing.

### Advantages
- **Larger Addressable Memory**: The main memory address space is not reduced because I/O devices use a separate address space.
- **Simplicity of I/O Control**: Dedicated I/O instructions can simplify the control of devices.

### Disadvantages
- **Additional Instructions Needed**: Requires different instructions for I/O operations, which can complicate programming.
- **Potentially Slower**: Accessing I/O devices can be slower compared to memory-mapped I/O due to the need for different instruction cycles.

## Summary of Differences

| Feature                       | Memory-Mapped I/O                  | Peripheral-Mapped I/O           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Address Space**             | Unified (shared with memory)       | Separate (dedicated for I/O)     |
| **Instruction Set**           | Uses standard memory instructions   | Uses specific I/O instructions    |
| **Addressing**                | Memory addressing techniques         | I/O addressing techniques          |
| **Hardware Complexity**       | More complex due to shared space    | Simpler due to separate spaces     |
| **Programming**               | Simpler (same instructions)         | More complex (different instructions) |
| **Memory Address Availability** | Reduced due to shared I/O addresses | Larger addressable memory space    |

# 18) Loosely coupled configuration.

### Loosely Coupled Configuration

A **loosely coupled configuration** in computer architecture refers to a system in which multiple processors (or computers) operate independently but can communicate with each other over a network or through message passing. Unlike closely coupled systems, each processor in a loosely coupled configuration has its own local memory and processes, and they collaborate primarily through inter-process communication mechanisms.

### Block Diagram of Loosely Coupled Configuration

Here is a simplified block diagram illustrating a loosely coupled configuration:

```
+-------------------+                 +-------------------+
|   Processor 1     |                 |   Processor 2     |

+-------------------+                 +-------------------+
```

### Explanation of Key Components

1. **Processors**:
   - Each processor (e.g., Processor 1, Processor 2, etc.) operates independently and has its own local memory. They execute their own tasks and do not share memory directly with other processors.

2. **Local Memory**:
   - Each processor has its own dedicated memory space, which it uses to store data and instructions needed for processing. This isolation allows processors to operate without contention for memory access.

3. **Interconnection Network**:
   - The processors communicate with each other through an interconnection network, which can include buses, switches, or dedicated communication links. This network facilitates message passing and data exchange between processors.

### Characteristics of Loosely Coupled Configuration

- **Independence**: Each processor operates independently, which allows for greater flexibility and fault tolerance.
- **Communication**: Processors communicate through messages rather than shared memory, reducing the complexity of synchronization.
- **Scalability**: Loosely coupled systems can be easily scaled by adding more processors, as each one can function independently.
- **Heterogeneity**: This configuration can accommodate different types of processors and architectures within the same system.

### Applications

- **Distributed Systems**: Loosely coupled configurations are often used in distributed computing environments, where tasks are spread across multiple machines connected via a network.
- **Cluster Computing**: In cluster computing, multiple computers work together to perform a task but remain independent, making this configuration suitable for large-scale computations.
- **Grid Computing**: Loosely coupled systems can effectively support grid computing, where resources from different locations are utilized to solve complex problems collaboratively.

# 19) Bus allocation schemes.

When discussing bus allocation schemes, we are referring to the methods used to manage and control access to a shared communication bus in a computer system. These schemes are crucial in multiprocessor systems, where multiple devices may need to communicate over the same bus. Below are some common bus allocation schemes:

### 1. **Static Bus Allocation**
In static bus allocation, the bus is assigned to a device or processor for a fixed amount of time. This method can be simple to implement but may lead to inefficiencies, especially if a device does not fully utilize its allocated time.

- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to design and implement.
  - Predictable access times for devices.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Inefficient use of the bus if not all devices need their allocated time.
  - Potential for underutilization of the bus.

### 2. **Dynamic Bus Allocation**
Dynamic bus allocation schemes assign the bus based on current demand and availability. Devices request access to the bus and are granted it based on certain criteria, such as priority or round-robin scheduling.

- **Advantages**:
  - More efficient use of the bus as it responds to actual demand.
  - Reduced waiting time for devices needing access.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex to implement compared to static allocation.
  - Can lead to longer access times if many devices are contending for the bus.

### 3. **Priority-Based Bus Allocation**
In priority-based bus allocation, each device is assigned a priority level. When a device requests access to the bus, the bus controller grants access based on the priority of the devices requesting it.

- **Advantages**:
  - Ensures that critical devices receive timely access to the bus.
  - Can improve overall system performance by prioritizing important tasks.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Lower-priority devices may experience starvation if high-priority devices continuously request access.
  - More complex hardware and software requirements.

### 4. **Round-Robin Bus Allocation**
In a round-robin scheme, each device is given a chance to use the bus in a cyclic order. This method ensures that all devices have equal opportunity to access the bus.

- **Advantages**:
  - Fair access to the bus for all devices.
  - Reduces the chance of starvation for any device.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - May not be efficient for devices with varying bandwidth needs.
  - Can lead to increased waiting times if many devices are contending for access.

### 5. **Token Ring**
In a token ring bus allocation scheme, a special token circulates around the bus. Only the device that holds the token can access the bus. This method prevents collisions and ensures orderly access.

- **Advantages**:
  - Collision-free access to the bus.
  - Predictable access times once the token is acquired.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - If the token is lost or corrupted, it can halt communication until a new token is generated.
  - Overhead associated with passing the token can reduce efficiency.

### Conclusion
The choice of bus allocation scheme depends on the specific requirements of the system, including the number of devices, their bandwidth needs, and the importance of real-time communication. Each scheme has its advantages and disadvantages, and often, a hybrid approach may be used to balance efficiency and fairness in bus access.
