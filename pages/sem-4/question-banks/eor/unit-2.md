## 6. (i) With neat sketch, explain the working of a stepper motor. (ii) With suitable illustration explain working on external and internal grippers.

**Answer:**

(i) **Working of a Stepper Motor:**

A stepper motor is an electromechanical device that converts electrical pulses into discrete mechanical movements (steps). Each pulse causes the motor to rotate by a fixed angle.

**Basic Components:**
1. **Stator:** The stationary part containing multiple coils arranged as electromagnets
2. **Rotor:** The rotating part, typically a permanent magnet or a toothed ferromagnetic core
3. **Controller:** Electronic circuit that sends electrical pulses to the stator coils

**Working Principle:**

Stepper motors work on the principle of electromagnetic attraction and repulsion. When current flows through the stator coils, they become electromagnets and attract/repel the rotor teeth or permanent magnets, causing rotation.

**Operation Sequence in a Four-Phase Stepper Motor:**

1. **Step 1:** Phase A is energized, creating a magnetic field that aligns the rotor with Phase A.
2. **Step 2:** Phase A is de-energized, and Phase B is energized, causing the rotor to turn to align with Phase B.
3. **Step 3:** Phase B is de-energized, and Phase C is energized, causing further rotation.
4. **Step 4:** Phase C is de-energized, and Phase D is energized.
5. **Cycle Repeats:** After Phase D, the sequence returns to Phase A, continuing the rotation.

**Types of Stepper Motors:**

1. **Variable Reluctance (VR) Stepper:**
   - Has a soft iron multi-toothed rotor
   - Works based on the principle of minimum reluctance
   - When a stator pole is energized, the nearest rotor teeth are attracted to minimize the magnetic path reluctance

2. **Permanent Magnet (PM) Stepper:**
   - Has a permanent magnet rotor
   - Alternating stator poles attract/repel the rotor
   - Usually has a step angle of 7.5° to 15° (24-48 steps per revolution)

3. **Hybrid Stepper:**
   - Combines features of both VR and PM types
   - Has a multi-toothed rotor with permanent magnets
   - Provides smaller step angles (typically 1.8° or 200 steps per revolution)

**Control Methods:**

1. **Full Step Mode:** One phase energized at a time, or two phases energized simultaneously
2. **Half Step Mode:** Alternating between one and two phases energized, doubling resolution
3. **Microstepping:** PWM control of phase currents to create intermediate positions

**Working Principle:**
1. The gripper starts in a collapsed position with elements retracted
2. The gripper is inserted into a hole or cavity in the object
3. The actuator is activated, causing the elements to expand outward
4. The elements press against the internal surface of the object
5. Sufficient force is applied to create friction between the elements and the object
6. To release, the actuator reverses, collapsing the elements
