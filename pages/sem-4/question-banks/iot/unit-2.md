## 3) Discuss various communication models in IoT, including Request-Response, Publish-Subscribe, Push-Pull, and Exclusive Pair, with diagrams & descriptions.

**1. Request-Response Model:**

- Request-Response is a communication model in which the client sends requests to the server and the server responds to the requests.
- When the server receives a request, it decides how to respond, fetches the data,retrieves resource representations, prepares the response, and then sends the response to the client.

**2. Publish-Subscribe Model:**

- Publish-Subscribe is a communication model that involves publishers, brokers and consumers.
- Publishers are the source of data. Publishers send the data to the topics which are managed by the Publishersbroker.
- When the broker receives data for a topic from the publisher, it sends the data to all the subscribed consumers.
